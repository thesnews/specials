			<p>During her freshman year, Resident Assistants strengthened communities and made connections in the dorms. This inspired current RA and nursing sophomore Lupe Grover and she felt that she could do the same.</p>
			
			<p>Now, working as an RA during the COVID-19 pandemic, things look different from the job she had aspired to hold.</p>
			
			<p>"The RA description is building communities, bringing people together," Grover said. "Now it's pull people apart, keep them safe."</p>

			<p>McDonel Hall RA and accounting senior Rylee Egan has been an RA since fall of 2019 after transferring to MSU from community college during her sophomore year. She said that this transition was rough for her, but it inspired her to be an RA.</p>
			
			<p>"I didn't make all those connections you make as a freshman in those first year classes and experiences, and so I wanted to help connect my student residents more and help them transition a bit better than I did," Egan said.</p>
			
			<p>Resident Assistants are typically <a class="hyperlink" href="https://liveon.msu.edu/staffstructure#:~:text=Resident%20Assistant&text=As%20a%20peer%2C%20an%20RA,residence%20halls%20and%20apartment%20communities." target="_blank">expected to provide leadership and support</a> to students and to help students adjust to the experience of living in a residence hall.</p>
