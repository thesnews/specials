			<p>On March 11, 2020, Michigan State announced via email that they would move all classes online immediately following two positive COVID-19 cases in the state of Michigan.</p>
			
			<p>In the year that's passed, there have been seismic shifts in every part of society as the virus has run rampant throughout the country. COVID-19 shut down schools, shut down businesses and added fuel to the fire of the political landscape, leading to nationwide protests and an armed insurrection.</p>
			
			<p>The pandemic has flipped everyone's lives on their head, causing them to constantly adapt to the changing world around them.</p>
			
			<p>"I just remember feeling very out of control because I'm very much someone that likes to be able to control stuff and that was a really tough thing," international relations and comparative cultures and politics freshman Hannah Woehrle said.</p>
			
			<p>Schools were shut down, which forced students and businesses to learn the world of Zoom and virtual learning. The pandemic forced everyone inside to be socially-distanced, causing widespread mental health issues for people, especially students.</p>
			
			<p>"You're going to class today, any day people love going in and feeling like they're learning something, but a lot of people lost their willpower to go," professional and public writing sophomore Emilio Zapata said.</p>

			<p>The pandemic has produced the lowest moments in life for many people while they deal with being isolated and having to learn or work online.</p>
			
			<p>"I felt like I was again losing that sense of control that I had always wanted and I felt I almost had put my life on pause," Woehrle said. "I think a lot of people have way more life-on-pause stories than this, but that was just a real disappointment."</p>
			
			<p>The end of the pandemic is in sight with the emergence of three COVID-19 vaccines, but cases and the death toll continue to rise. The pandemic has lasted a year, changing every aspect of society with unmeasurable, lasting impacts on society moving forward.</p>
			
			<p>Here's a look back at the past year — what life looked like in a pandemic.</p>

			<p>The discourse about a stolen election continued into 2021 and reached a head-on Jan. 6 when a large group of rioters <a class="hyperlink" href="https://statenews.com/article/2021/01/protesters-swarm-the-u-s-capitol-amidst-electoral-counting" target="_blank">broke into the U.S. Capitol building</a> to try and overturn the results of the election.</p>

			<p>The attempted insurrection did not lead to a change in the results of the election, and Biden was sworn in as president two weeks later.</p>  

			<p>Michigan State also began its spring semester by <a class="hyperlink" href="https://statenews.com/article/2021/01/3800-students-return-to-msu-dorms-ahead-of-spring-semester" target="_blank">welcoming 3,800 students back to campus</a> as they increased the number of in-person classes while the threat of COVID-19 loomed.</p>

			<p>February started with Michigan State receiving the <a class="hyperlink" href="https://statenews.com/article/2021/02/largest-single-donation-to-msu-athletics" target="_blank">largest donation in school history</a> from former Michigan State basketball player Mat Ishbia, totaling $32 million. Ishbia made the donation to improve athletic facilities and enhance university athletics.</p> 

			<p>Prep sports remained banned by the state government leading to more protests at the state Capitol from parents and students to reinstate contact sports. The Let Them Play protests led to high school sports being reinstated later in February.</p> 

			<p>The Larry Nassar scandal reared its ugly head at the end of the month once again, when former gymnastics coach <a class="hyperlink" href="" target="_blank">John Geddert</a> was arrested for human trafficking and sexual assault in an investigation tied to Nassar.
