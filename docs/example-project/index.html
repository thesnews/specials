				Every morning, advertising management freshman Ryan Weir enjoys a cup of coffee before going to class.
				When he
				returns from campus, he sips on another, and if he has something going on that night, he’ll indulge in a
				third.
			</p>
			<p>
				Weir embodies a stereotypical college student with his caffeine intake, but the stereotype that college
				students
				drink an excessive amount of caffeine does not appear to be the truth of the matter.
			</p>
			<p>
				In fact, in a survey of 100 Michigan State students, 34 percent indicated that they do not drink any
				coffee, and
				another 29 percent said they only have one to three cups of coffee per week.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Honestly, I&#x27;m not really big on the coffee taste,” English education sophomore Adriana Lulgjuraj
				said. “I
				kind of do it more socially, so if my friends are going to Starbucks, I&#x27;ll pick up an iced coffee
				or
				something… I&#x27;m just an energized bunny on my own, so I don&#x27;t really need the caffeine to get
				me going
				or wake me up.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Graphic design sophomore Kailey Nguyen agreed, adding that she worries about becoming dependent on
				caffeine.
			</p>
			<p>
				“One of my friends, he drinks a lot of coffee and I hear a lot of nasty stuff about waking up with a
				migraine
				without a cup of coffee or something like that,&quot; Nguyen said. &quot;Or somebody&#x27;s mood being
				entirely
				dependent on whether or not they&#x27;ve had caffeine that day. It’s really not desirable.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Weir has been on the other side of this phenomenon. There are multiple times where he&#x27;s taken
				coffee breaks
				and gets headaches or doesn&#x27;t feel his best.
			</p>

			<p>
				Some East Lansing staples include Blue Owl and Foster Coffee Co. Weir prefers the latter for its
				design and
				atmosphere.
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;I think being around a social setting and people working motivates me to get stuff done, too,
				whereas if
				I&#x27;m in my apartment, there&#x27;s no one there to pressure me to get stuff done,” Weir said.
			</p>
			<p>
				Coffee is known to be pricey when purchased from a shop, which is why 29.2 percent of students
				surveyed said
				they make their own coffee, and 25.8 percent of students surveyed said they both buy and make their
				own coffee
				equally.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I got the big jug from Costco of ground coffee,” Turrill said. “It&#x27;s definitely a lot cheaper
				than going
				to Starbucks every day.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Overall, regardless of how much coffee and general caffeine MSU students consume, most students
				realize that
				excess caffeine intake can and will negatively affect one’s health.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, Nguyen has in the past drank coffee to keep her up through the night to grind out an
				assignment,
				but she does not think this is good for anyone if done often.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it,” Nguyen said. “I have definitely done that where I have
				stayed up and
				tried to finish a project on time and it very negatively impacted the outcome of the project and the
				homework in
				general as well as just being very irritable and groggy in the morning. I&#x27;m not at my full
				capacity.”
